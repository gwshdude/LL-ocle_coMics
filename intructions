Requirements:

Ollama installed and background/server process running. Change apis.py if you've modified your ollama api

Raw comic image files and an html file containing OCR data for each page in a specific format. Really just use mokuro and it'll make the html file for you.

Instructions:

1. Download and install Mokuro via git clone

2. git clone this repo

3. run mokuro by using the terminal command "mokuro {insert/path/to/comic/pages/folder/here}

4. put the html file that mokuro gives you in this repo's "input" folder

5. run this repo's "app.py" and use the GUI to choose your favorite ollama model for translation. I recommend you use "ollama run hf.co/mradermacher/RpR-v4-Fast-30B-A3B" and try that model. I've tested it with 4bit or Q4 quant. System prompt is currently in apis.py

6. put the html file that showed up in this repo's "output" folder somewhere that has a copy of the folder of images you used for mokuro, this folder must be in the same directory as the html file.
